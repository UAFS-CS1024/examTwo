Using the provided Eclipse Project and **Solution.java** file.  Implement the **oddEvens() method**.

In this array, all of the *digits that represent an even number* in the string should appear at the beginning of the array in the order they were entered (left to right).  The even digits should be followed by all of the *digits that represent an odd number* in the *reverse order they were entered into the array (right to left)*.
